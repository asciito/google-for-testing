This is a **personal project**, but the community can also contribute to this project, and is build with [Laravel Zero](https://github.com/laravel-zero/laravel-zero).

## The why?

It's simple, because I need a tool to manage my Chrome Driver and Chrome Browser, but... the reason behind that
is that in my work, I need to automate some interaction in a webpage, and because that page doesn't have an API, and doing some manual tasks
is painfully boring... and, trying to spin-up a Chrome Driver server
with the correct Browser Version, is painful (I **HATE** manual tasks), I decided to create this tiny CLI (in commands, not in size) to help me.

**I HATE MANUAL TASKS**
