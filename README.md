## The why?

It's simple, because I need a tool to manage my Chrome Driver and Chrome Browser, but... the reason behind that
is that in my work, I need to automate some interaction in a webpage, and because that page doesn't have an API, and doing some manual tasks
is painfully boring... and, trying to spin-up a Chrome Driver server
with the correct Browser Version, is painful (I **HATE** manual tasks), I decided to create this tiny CLI (in commands, not in size) to help me.

**I HATE MANUAL TASKS**

## Documentation

* [Commands](#commands)
  * [Install Google Chrome Browser](#install-google-chrome-browser)
  * [Install Google Chrome Driver](#install-google-chrome-driver)

### Commands

The two installation commands shares similar signatures, something like this:

```bash
./google-for-testing install:<browser|driver> [options]
```

There are three options available to change the way the command works.

- **`--ver=[VER]`**:
This option by default is set to `115.0.5763.0` in both commands.
    > **Note**:
    For the `install:driver` command, the default version it's really important, this is the started version from where you can get
    the `chromedriver` binary, before that version, we don't have access to it (for now).

- **`--latest`**:
This option will download the latest version.

- **`--path=[PATH]`**:
This will let you choose where to download it.

> **Note**:
> The default location for every download is `$HOME/.google-for-testing`
